* What is an Struct in Go?
  - A struct is a composite data type in Go, short for "structure."
  - It allows you to group related properties (fields) into a single unit, making your code more organized and readable.
  - If you're familiar with JavaScript, a struct in Go is conceptually similar to an "object" in JavaScript.
  - It is useful when you want to represent real-world entities or models with multiple properties.

* SYNTAX:
  - type StructName struct {
        FieldName DataType
        FieldName DataType
    }
